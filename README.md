**Drag-and-Drop Interface:**

Users can drag and drop electric elements onto a virtual canvas, replicating the process of setting up a real electric circuit.

**Connection Establishment:**

The simulation allows users to establish connections between different electric elements, fostering experimentation and learning in a visual context.

**Real-Time Readings:**

Users can take readings from various components within the circuit, offering insights into the behavior of the simulated system.

**Graph Plotting with Plotly:**

Integration of Plotly enables users to dynamically plot graphs based on the obtained readings, providing a visual representation of electrical data.

**Validation Mechanism:**

A stringent validation mechanism ensures the correctness of circuit configurations, providing users with instant feedback on the integrity and accuracy of their connections.

**Fault-Tolerant Algorithm:**

The system incorporates an advanced algorithm designed for fault tolerance, boasting a remarkable 98% accuracy in calculations. Even in the face of circuit failures, the algorithm ensures uninterrupted functionality and accurate readings.
Learning Outcomes:

The development of this project has led to a solid understanding of JavaScript, JsPlumb, and Plotly. It encompasses hands-on learning in creating an interactive and visually appealing web application, focusing on electric circuit simulation, drag-and-drop functionality, real-time data visualization, and the implementation of robust algorithms for fault tolerance.

**Future Enhancements:**

Future enhancements could include expanding the library of electric components, introducing more complex circuit configurations, and incorporating additional features for in-depth analysis of electrical phenomena. User feedback and iterative development could further refine and improve the simulation's capabilities.

This Interactive Electric Circuit Simulation serves as an educational and exploratory tool, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application in the field of electrical engineering.
